# Tic-Toe-Game
Hey people, this is hshahbaz63, Md. Shahbaz Hussain , final yr CSE student at BCET, Durgapur.

This is simple tic-tac-toe game designed by me using C++ to implement min-max algorithm. You just have to input row and column of your choice and this will automatically select its choice, just compile it using C++ or G++ compiler.  


Happy Coding :)
